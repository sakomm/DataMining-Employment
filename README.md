# DataMining Final Project 

## Project Motivation and Background

As Computer Science students about to enter the job market, we're concerned about the volatility of the tech industry. We want to analyze and create a system that can help people understand the markets, plan an exit strategy, and alleviate these concerns.

## Project Goal:

The goal of our project is to analyze trends in companies' recent layoffs in a variety of industries (aerospace, travel, retail, etc.) and detect patterns and trends. This will be done by looking at the number of employees laid off, the location of the companies, their stages, and the funds they have raised.
